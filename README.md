# OpenBazaar-Installer

In this repository we'll have the scripts necessary to create binary distributions for different operating systems.
The goal here is to have a 1-step build process.

## Linux

Coming soon!

## Windows

To build the Windows installer on Linux and OSX you can run:

* sh make_openbazaar.sh win32 (32-bit)
* sh make_openbazaar.sh win64 (64-bit)

Remember to clear out the temp/ folder before building a different architecture

## OSX

Coming soon!
